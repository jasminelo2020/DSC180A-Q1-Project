# DSC180A-Q1-Project
Quarter 1 Project for Robust and Interpretable Neural Network Models for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing Capstone

To reproduce the code, download any notebook and run it (I used Google Colab). Each notebook should be able to be run separately, and not need any outside requirements. All requirements will be met in the notebook (each notebook includes a cell where you clone from the official CLIP-Dissect repository). Extra comments are included in each notebook for more information.
