# DSC180A-Q1-Project
Quarter 1 Project for Robust and Interpretable Neural Network Models for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing Capstone

To reproduce the code, download any notebook and run it (I used Google Colab). Data will be stored locally or wherever you run the code. Each notebook should be able to be run separately, and not need any outside requirements. No software dependencies required. All requirements will be met in the notebook (each notebook includes a cell where you clone from the official CLIP-Dissect repository). Extra comments are included in each notebook for more information.
